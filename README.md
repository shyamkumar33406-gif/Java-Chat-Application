💬Java Chat Application

A **real-time group chat system** built using **Java Socket Programming** and **Multithreading**.
This project showcases the core principles of **client-server communication**, **message broadcasting**, and **network concurrency**.

 🧠 Overview

* The **Java Chat Application** allows multiple users to exchange messages over a network in real-time.
* It utilizes **TCP sockets** for reliable communication and **threads** to manage multiple clients simultaneously.
* Every connected client can send messages that are broadcast to all other users.
* This project serves as an excellent introduction to Java networking and can be enhanced with features like private messaging, file transfer, and encryption.


 ⚙ Features

* Real-time group chatting among multiple users
* Reliable communication using **TCP**
* Multi-threaded handling of multiple clients
* Centralized **message broadcasting system**
* Console-based interface (can be upgraded to GUI)
* Secure management of socket streams

 🚀 How to Run

1️⃣ Start the Server**

```bash
javac Server.java
java Server
```

2️⃣ Run the Clients (in separate terminals)**

```bash
javac Client.java
java Client
```

3️⃣ Start Chatting!**
Type messages in any client terminal — each message will be broadcast to all connected users.

 🔍 Working Principle

* The server listens for incoming connections using a **ServerSocket**.
* Each client connection is managed by a dedicated thread (**ClientHandler**).
* Messages from one client are shared with all others through shared output streams.
* The **multi-threaded architecture** ensures that one slow client doesn’t delay others.

 💡 Applications

* Real-time group chats for classrooms or teams
* Internal communication systems for organizations
* Prototype for modern chat applications (e.g., WhatsApp, Messenger)
* Educational tool for learning **socket programming** and **concurrency**

🧱 Future Enhancements

* Graphical User Interface (GUI) using **JavaFX** or **Swing**
* End-to-end message encryption
* Private or direct messaging
* User authentication system
* File sharing and media transfer
* Cloud-hosted chat server deployment

 🏁 Conclusion

The **Java Chat Application** provides a strong foundation for building and understanding network-based communication in Java.
It deepens knowledge of **TCP socket programming**, **client-server architecture**, and **thread synchronization**.
With further development, it can evolve into a fully-featured, secure, and user-friendly chat platform.
